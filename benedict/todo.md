# Todo

* Asyncronous code
* Game controller
* Design input embeddings for network
* a3c model seems promising

# Race Condition
during training, priority for challenging determined by id, with randomizing ids between games this should be fine
during online play, add delay of 3s before challenging

# Model
PPO for training,
LSTM core or attention network for model
